Currently I feel busy, since I am doing this course along my work as a researcher. I expect to do better version control for my code and to have basic knowledge on how to do some statistical tests that I haven't previously done. I discovered the course through a course catalog and was immediately excited about the course. 

_Exercise set 1 was mostly rehearsing for me. I have done almost every topic that was there in my work or previous courses._ 

The RMarkdown practice is nice though. I will try to write my future reports also with Markdown.
